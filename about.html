  <p> Growing up in Atlanta, I have seen dramatic inequality throughout my city. However, I have attended private school throughout my life, and I did not realize how devastating the educational inequality is until quite recently. Beginning in December of 2020, I began tutoring Hispanic children in Atlanta through an organization called La Amistad. One child clearly struggled with math and often could not answer simple multiplication questions, despite being in fourth grade. I remembered how at my private school, I was learning long division at that age, and I was pained to realize the truth of educational inequality. I know that there are many other children out there like her, who have not realized the joys of learning because the system has not been able to provide for them. I hope that one day the American school system will modernize to attend to each child's needs, regardless of race or income, in order to create a better future. </p>
