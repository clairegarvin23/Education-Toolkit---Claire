  <p id="topp"> Education is the key to creating a more equal future in America. However, in states across the country, children of different races and income levels recieve dramatically different educations, which is often demonstrated by their test scores. This inequality has allowed other countries to surpass America in education. </p>

  <h3 id="paragraph"> How did this happen? </h3>
  
  <p> By the 1970s, America had one of the best school systems in the world, and gaps between white and minority students was narrowing. Now, achievement gaps between races have remained almost completely stagnant since 1965, except in the South, and <span class="bold">test results often place American students at or below average </span>. Studies demonstrate that currently the root of educational inequality comes from dramatic income inequality. However,  many minorities are more likely to face poverty and lower income levels than white students. Therefore, the issue of education is entangled with <span class="bold">racial injustice, income inequality, </span> and difficulty in overcoming <span class="bold">social mobility</span>. <span class="super"> <a href= "https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-02-16/the-costs-of-inequality-education-is-the-key-to-it-all" alt="link to source for this article">2</a> </span>
 </p>

 
  
   <p> Other factors dramatically affect school performance, including home life, peer influence, and more. However, many researchers believe that improving the education system will serve as the most direct way to provide equity for all. For example, Harvard economist Roland Fryer believes that "good schools would close the education gap faster and better than addressing any other social factor, including curtailing poverty and violence, and he believes that the quality of kindergarten through grade 12 matters above all." <span class="super"> <a href= "https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-02-16/the-costs-of-inequality-education-is-the-key-to-it-all" alt="link to source for this article">2</a></p>

  <h3 id="paragraph">How can we change the system?</h3>
  <p>"We do know that <span class="bold">early childhood education, school integration, educational spending, certain charter schools, and better teachers </span> can benefit students in the long run, sometimes substantially so." <span class="super"><a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/2018/3/23/21104601/race-not-just-poverty-shapes-who-graduates-in-america-and-other-education-lessons-from-a-big-new-stu">6</a></span></p> 

  <p> We can also look at other school systems that have surpassed us. Currently, Finland has one the best school systems in the world, as well as Japan, Canada, and the United Kingdom. In Finland, teachers are regarded as highly as doctors and lawyers, and their education is much more extensive. For example, they must obtain a master's degree and shadow other teachers. In the US, teaching shortages have led to dire circumstances in which many teachers are unqualified or unhappy in their positions. Researchers argue that implementing a more competitive and extensive training would produce more qualified teachers. Other major differences include Finland's limited use of standardized testing and school evaluations. This practice produces more cooperation, not competitiveness. </p>
